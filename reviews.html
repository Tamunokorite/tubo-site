                            First time in T's Spot and YOU have to go! It's the cutest little spot with amazing food.
                            The amala is to die for. IT WAS FIRE!! The service we received was so amazing and we will
                            definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience.

                            This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. 
                            They know what they're doing and what they're talking about, and you can tell making the
                             customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics and
                              some twists, and for their prices it's 100% worth it.

                            Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard.
                             Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it and they do different
                              deals on different nights so it's worth checking them out before you book. Highly
                               recommended.

                            We are so fortunate to have this place just a few minutes drive away from school.
                             Food is stunning, both the tapas and downstairs restaurant. Cocktails wow, wine
                              great and lovely selection of beers. Love this place and will continue to visit.                        </p>

                            I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in T's Spot. 
                            I had a 3 course meal, with a couple of beers. Considering the quality, the
                             price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want a romantic night out. There
                              was also plenty of room for bigger groups.
